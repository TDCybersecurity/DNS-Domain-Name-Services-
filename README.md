# **DNS Domain Names Services| System**
DNS, or Domain Name System, is like the phone book of the Internet.  When you want to visit a website, you type in its name like (www.examplewebsite.com) into the browser.
DNS translates that name into the numerical IP Address like (192.1.2.1) that computers use to find each other on the internet.
This way, you don't have to remember a string of numbers; you just need to know the website's name, and DNS takes care of the rest, guiding your browser to the right place.



















**DNS** is the acronym for **Domain Name Services**, which acts like a directory that translates **human-readable domain names** into **IP addresses**.

**Understanding DNS**

- DNS converts computer names (such as client-1.mydomain.com or [**www.google.com**](http://www.google.com/) ) to IP addresses which can be used by the computer to locate resources.
- DNS is integrated with Active Directory and automatically installed on DC-B in the last lab.
- In this lab we will use **Client-B** and **DC-B** to do a few exercises for the sake of understanding DNS a bit better.

**Overview (What we are going to do)**

- Inspect **DNS A-Records** on the server (hostname to IP address mappings).
- Create some of our own **A-Records** on the server and observe them from the client.
- Delete records from the server and inspect/clear the **client DNS cache** to gain a better understanding.
- Touch on **"CNAME"** records (mapping one name to another name).
- **Discuss Root Hints**: If we're using our local DNS server to resolve names into IP addresses, how can we still access sites like Google and others on the internet? Does our local DNS server know about these sites?

<h1>1 A-Record Exercise</h1>

1. Connect/log into **DC-B** as your Domain Admin Account (mydomain.com\jane\_admin).
2. Connect/log into **Client-B** as an admin (mydomain\Joe\_Admin).
3. From **Client-B** try to ping "mainframe" and notice that it **FAILS**.
4. **nslookup**"mainframe" notice that it FAILS (no DNS record)
5. Create a DNS A-record on **DC-B** for "mainframe" and have it point to **DC-B**'s Private IP address.

<h1>2 Local DNS Cache Exercise</h1>

<h1>3 CNAME Record Exercise</h1>

Go back to ~~**DC-B**~~ and create a **CNAME** record that points the host " **search**" to [www.google.com](http://www.google.com/).

Go back to **Client-B** and attempt to ping " **search**", observe the results of the CNAME record.

On **Client-B**, nslookup " **search**", observe the results of the CNAME record.
